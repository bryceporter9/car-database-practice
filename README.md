# car-database-practice
A web based application to manipulate and display MySQL query's on an Apache database.

Currently the files are setup just by file type. I would appreciate any feedback or recomedended approaches to my general format with the files/folders. I am using this for fun, not for ny other purposes. I hope you will help me to understand PHP syntax more! 

Please feel free to add to this project, I would greatly appreciate it!
